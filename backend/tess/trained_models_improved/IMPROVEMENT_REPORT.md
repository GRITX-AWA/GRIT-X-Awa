## Next Steps

### âœ… Deploy Improved Model

The model has achieved the target confidence of >90%!

**Deployment Steps:**
```powershell
cd backend
& ".\venv\Scripts\python.exe" deploy_improved_tess.py
```

**What this will do:**
1. Backup current models to `tess/trained_models_backup/`
2. Deploy improved models to `tess/trained_models/`
3. Validate deployment
4. Ready for production use

### Monitor Performance

After deployment:
1. Test with real data: `python test_tess_prediction.py`
2. Monitor production predictions
3. Track confidence metrics over time
4. Compare with previous model performance

### Future Optimizations (Optional)

While we've achieved >90% confidence, further improvements could include:

1. **Class Reduction** (6 â†’ 4 classes)
   - Merge similar classes for even higher confidence
   - Could push confidence toward 95%+

2. **Ensemble Weight Optimization**
   - Current: 0.4, 0.35, 0.25
   - Could optimize based on validation performance

3. **Additional Data**
   - Collect more TESS observations
   - Expand training set

4. **Neural Networks**
   - Try deep learning approaches
   - Potentially achieve 95%+ confidence
